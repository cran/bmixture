Description: Provides statistical tools for Bayesian estimation of finite mixture of distributions, mainly mixture of Gamma, Normal and t-distributions. The package is implemented the Bayesian literature for the finite mixture of distributions, including Mohammadi and et al. (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00180-012-0323-3> and Mohammadi and Salehi-Rad (2012) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2011.588358>.
